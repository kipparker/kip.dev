## Who?

I'm Kip, I'm an independent web developer. I build web platforms and other digital products for a diverse list of clients. Over a twenty year plus career I've been able to work on all kinds of projects, from e-commerce sites to streaming platforms to co-founding and building a dating site. More recently I've been working with data science teams to create data products from their work.

## What?

I work as a consultant or a freelancer. I can lead teams, add capabilities to an existing team, or design
and build a project from a concept to launch. I work right across the web stack, from infrastructure to
front end, which gives me a detailed overview of any project. I'm good at sharing knowledge, and explaining new technology to
others whatever their background.

I find simple ways to do complex things.

## Where?

I live and work in [Romney Marsh](https://www.google.com/maps/@50.9871111,0.9586146,21436m/data=!3m1!1e3) on the Kent Coast. We're closer to France than London, and I work with clients across Europe as well as in the UK.

Have a project you think I can help with? I'd love to talk to you about it - [hello@kip.dev](mailto:hello@kip.dev)
