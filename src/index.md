### Who?

I'm Kip, an independent software developer with over twenty years of experience building web platforms and digital products for a diverse range of clients. My projects have ranged from e-commerce and streaming platforms to co-founding a startup dating app.

For many years I focused on creating and deploying data and machine learning-driven platforms, working as a consultant with data science teams in industry. I'm now using that expertise to concentrate on climate change and net-zero initiatives.

### What?

I work as a consultant or a freelancer. I can lead teams, add capabilities to an existing team, or design
and build a project from a concept to launch. I work right across the web stack, from infrastructure to
front end, which gives me a detailed overview of any project. I'm good at sharing knowledge, and explaining new technology to
others whatever their background.

I find simple ways to do complex things.

### Where?

I live and work in [Romney Marsh](https://www.google.com/maps/@50.9871111,0.9586146,21436m/data=!3m1!1e3) on the Kent Coast. We're closer to France than London, and I work with clients across Europe as well as in the UK.

Have a project you think I can help with? I'd love to talk to you about it. Email [hello@kip.dev](mailto:hello@kip.dev), or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kipparker/).
