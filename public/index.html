            <h2>Who am I?</h2>

            <p>I'm Kip, I'm an independent web developer. I build web platforms and other digital things for a diverse list of
                clients. Over a twenty year plus career I've been able to work on all kinds of projects, from
                e-commerce sites to streaming platforms to co-founding and building a dating site. More recently I've been
                working with data science teams to create data products from their work.</p>

            <h2>What do I do?</h2>

            <p>I work as a consultant or a freelancer. I can lead teams, add capabilities to an existing team, or design
                and build a project from a concept to launch. I work right across the web stack, from infrastructure to
                front end, which gives me a detailed overview of any project. I'm good at sharing knowledge, and explaining new technology to
                others whatever their background.
            </p>
            <p> I am happy to use whatever tool is best for the job, but most often my projects
                use python alongside React or Svelte, with serverless deployments on AWS using serverless framework and cloudformation.
            </p>

            <p>I try to find simple ways to do complex things.</p>

            <h2>Where am I?</h2>

            <p>I live and work in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@50.9871111,0.9586146,21436m/data=!3m1!1e3">Romney Marsh</a> on the Kent Coast. We're as close to France as to London, and I work with
                clients across Europe as well as in the UK.</p>

            <p>Have a project you think I can help with? I'd love to talk to you about it - <a
